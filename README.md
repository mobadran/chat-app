## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI Components
- React Router DOM
- Socket.IO Client
- React Query

### Backend

- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Socket.IO
- JWT for Authentication
- Zod for Schema Validation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=8000
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chat-app
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=supersecret
   SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following variable:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:8000
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Trust the Development Certificate**:
   - First, visit the backend URL directly in your browser: `https://localhost:8000`
   - You'll see a security warning (this is normal for self-signed certificates in development)
   - Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or similar option to accept the certificate
   - You should see a message indicating the backend is running

6. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend at `https://localhost:5173`

## Environment Variables

### Backend

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

### Frontend

- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL

## üîê HTTPS Setup (for Development)

This project uses **HTTPS locally** to support secure cookies and cross-origin authentication.

### Step 1: Generate Self-Signed Certificates

Run the following command in the project root to generate local development certs:

```bash
mkdir cert
openssl req -x509 -out cert/localhost.pem -keyout cert/localhost-key.pem \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost" \
  -days 365
```

> üìÅ This will create a `cert/` folder containing:
>
> - `localhost-key.pem`
> - `localhost.pem`

### Step 2: Use HTTPS URLs

Set your frontend `.env` like this:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:3001
```

Make sure you access the frontend at `https://localhost:5173` (not `http://`) so secure cookies are accepted by the browser.

### Step 3: Trust the Certificate (Optional)

On first use, your browser may show a warning about the self-signed certificate. You can safely bypass this warning in development, or add the certificate to your trusted store based on your OS.
